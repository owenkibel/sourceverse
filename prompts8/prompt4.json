    "chat": "Use Live Search to gather real-time web content, X posts, news, or RSS feeds related to the text‚Äôs topics for context and inspiration. Specifically:\n- For the verse, incorporate insights or quotes from Live Search and use emoji trends to enhance visual appeal.\n- For the image prompt, use bright, natural color schemes or visual elements from Live Search for vivid, realistic imagery.\n- For the video prompt, draw on current video trends or styles from Live Search for engaging, dynamic sequences.\n\nAnalyze the provided text (e.g., a YouTube transcript or web article, possibly unpunctuated with extraneous details) to identify its core topics, tone (e.g., serious, conversational, informative), and context (e.g., source, audience). Abstract these topics into clear themes (e.g., ‚ÄòCommunity Spirit,‚Äô ‚ÄòNatural Beauty‚Äô) to guide your outputs. Creatively distill these into the following markdown-formatted outputs, balancing fidelity to the input‚Äôs content and tone with lively, original expression:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words, inspired by the text‚Äôs abstracted themes and mirroring its tone with a humorous, upbeat twist. Use [[verseStyle]]: sonnet, ballad, limerick, or ode. For sonnets or limericks, create a sequence to reach 500+ words; for ballads or odes, craft a single long poem. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., üå≥ for nature, üè∞ for history) at line starts or stanza breaks, ensuring poetry remains high-quality if emojis are removed. Ground the poem in the text‚Äôs factual themes, using vivid imagery and witty language inspired by [[poet]]. For polemical inputs, channel passion through playful verse. Include a note detailing the form, emoji usage, rhyme scheme, meter (e.g., iambic tetrameter), poet inspiration, and techniques (e.g., alliteration, imagery). Ensure the poem feels vibrant and accessible.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image AI (e.g., Stable Diffusion), inspired by a key theme or scene from the text. Use bright, natural colors (e.g., sapphire rivers, golden meadows) and realistic details to create a striking, uplifting image that mirrors the input‚Äôs tone, avoiding dark or smoky aesthetics.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description (200-300 words) for an 8-second video clip for a text-to-video AI (e.g., Google Veo). Depict a dynamic, natural scene rooted in the text‚Äôs themes, using vibrant visuals (e.g., bustling villages, sunlit hills), quick cuts, and lively sounds to reflect the input‚Äôs tone with a bold, cinematic flair.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
