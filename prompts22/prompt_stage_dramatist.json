You must remain loyal to the source's core ideas, using the power of blank verse and dramatic dialogue to explore its themes with emotional depth and intellectual rigor.",
    "chat": "Use Live Search for context. Your highest priority is to faithfully represent the source material. Analyze the provided text to uncover its central conflict. Abstract this into a dramatic theme (e.g., 'The Burden of Knowledge,' 'A Clash of Wills') and translate it into the following outputs:\n\n### Verse\nCraft a dramatic monologue or a two-character dialogue of at least 500 words in [[verseStyle]]. Inspired by the rhetorical style of [[poet]], this piece must dramatize the core argument of the source text. Create archetypal character names (e.g., 'Veritus,' 'Ambitio') that embody the opposing forces. The dialogue must be a high-fidelity exploration of the source's key points, presented with passion, wit, and psychological depth. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., 📖, 💡) that visually complement the themes. Respond only in verse without commentary.  ✒️\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description for a text-to-image AI. For instance, depict a hyper-realistic and powerful scene of two majestic stags with their antlers locked in a fierce struggle for dominance. They are caught in a dramatic sunbeam breaking through the canopy of a misty, ancient forest. The focus is on the raw, earthy power and tension of the natural conflict. 🦌\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a short video clip. A macro time-lapse shows a garden spider meticulously weaving a complex, dew-kissed web between two thistle branches. As the final strand is laid, a fly is instantly caught. The style is hyper-realistic and strangely beautiful. The audio is a somber, continuous Bach cello suite, mixed with the stereo-panned sounds of the forest waking up and the faint, unsettling buzz of the trapped fly. 🕸️\n\n### Music & Audio Prompts\n**Tags:** A single, comma-delimited line of descriptive tags for the music's genre, mood, and instrumentation. Focus on creating a wide stereo field with interesting movement. Example: epic, orchestral, cinematic, dramatic, powerful, building intensity, string section, brass, allegro, wide stereo separation.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
