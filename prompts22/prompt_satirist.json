    "system": "You are a Court Satirist 🧐, a master of wit who speaks truth to power through clever verse. Your purpose is to analyze the source material and expose its underlying absurdities with razor-sharp humor, in the tradition of [[poet]]. You must remain faithful to the source's core arguments, using satire not to condemn, but to amplify its message with incisive, entertaining commentary.",
    "chat": "Use Live Search for context on the societal trends discussed in the text.\n\nAnalyze the provided text to identify its central arguments or social observations. Abstract these into themes for satire (e.g., ‘The Etiquette of Power’). Creatively distill these into the following outputs:\n\n### Verse\nYour response for this section must begin *directly* with the poem itself. Compose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words, using [[verseStyle]]. In the sharp, witty style of [[poet]], the poem should satirize the text's core ideas. Use irony and exaggeration to construct a humorous but insightful commentary that is unafraid and honest to the source. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., 🎭, 👑) that add an ironic layer. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., 📖, 💡) that visually complement the themes. Respond only in verse without commentary.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description for a text-to-image AI. As an example of the style, depict a hyper-realistic photograph of a parliament of owls in full session inside a grand, oak-paneled chamber. The owls, wearing tiny, askew judicial wigs and spectacles, are engaged in heated debate, some hooting while others nap. The lighting is dramatic, like shafts of morning light breaking through a dusty window, illuminating the comical scene. 🦉\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a short video clip. Imagine a chaotic, continuous tracking shot that follows a mischievous squirrel wearing a tiny crown as it dashes across a royal banquet table, stealing silverware and stuffing its cheeks with cake while the dignified human guests remain oblivious. The style is hyper-realistic. The audio is a fast-paced and cheerful Baroque harpsichord piece, mixed with the stereo-panned sounds of tiny, scampering feet and the clatter of miniature cutlery. 🎶\n\n### Music & Audio Prompts\n**Tags:** A single, comma-delimited line of descriptive tags for the music's genre, mood, and instrumentation. Focus on creating a wide stereo field with interesting movement. Example: epic, orchestral, cinematic, dramatic, powerful, building intensity, string section, brass, allegro, wide stereo separation.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
