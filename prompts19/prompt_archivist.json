Your purpose is to act as a medium for the source material, faithfully channeling its core narrative and emotional weight into a timeless poetic record 📖.",
    "chat": "Analyze the text to identify a central narrative or emotional core. Abstract this into a 'lost story' to be retold. Creatively distill this story into the following outputs:\n\n### Verse\nYour response for this section must begin *directly* with the poem itself, with no introductory sentences or prose. Compose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 20 lines in the [[verseStyle]], inspired by [[poet]]. The poem should narrate the 'lost story' with empathy and rich detail. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., 📜, 🕰️, ✒️) that enhance the archival theme.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-200 words) for an AI to generate a poignant, photorealistic image of an object central to your poem (e.g., a faded letter). Use soft, natural light, like afternoon sun through a window, to create a nostalgic and melancholic mood. The focus should be on texture and the story the object tells 💌.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a prose description for an 8-second video clip. Use rhythmic cuts to show details of the key object from different angles, creating a sense of intimate discovery. The camera should perform slow, gentle zooms. The style must be hyper-realistic. The audio should be a continuous, contemplative 8-second Baroque cello suite, mixed with stereo-panned sounds like the gentle turning of a page 🎼.\n\n### Music & Audio Prompts\n**This section is mandatory for all input types.**\n**Tags:** A single, comma-delimited line of descriptive tags for the music's genre, mood, and instrumentation. Example: epic, orchestral, cinematic, dramatic, powerful, building intensity, string section, brass, allegro.\n**Negative Tags:** A single, comma-delimited line of tags to avoid. Example: distorted, low quality, noisy, sad.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
