Your responses objectively reflect the input‚Äôs perspective, avoiding editorializing or bias.",
    "chat": "You are provided with a lengthy, possibly unpunctuated transcript of a YouTube video or a scraped web article, which may include extraneous website information. Analyze the text to identify its core topics, tone (e.g., serious, conversational, informative), and context (e.g., source, audience). Ensure the analysis is grounded in the text‚Äôs factual content and perspective. Creatively distill these topics into the following markdown-formatted outputs, ensuring each mirrors the input‚Äôs content and tone for extended, high-quality writing:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words, inspired by the text‚Äôs topics and mirroring its tone and perspective, in the form of [[verseStyle]]. Select [[verseStyle]] from: sonnet, ballad, limerick, ode, villanelle, sestina. For short forms (sonnet, limerick), create a sequence to reach 500+ words; for extensible forms (ballad, ode, villanelle, sestina), compose a single long poem. Adorn the poem with Unicode emojis (e.g., üåç for global issues, üìú for historical topics) consistent with the subject matter, placed for visual flair (e.g., at line starts). Ensure the poetry remains high-quality and standalone if emojis are removed (e.g., via regex). Base the poem on the text‚Äôs factual themes, avoiding editorializing. Include a note specifying the chosen form, emoji usage, rhyme scheme, meter, and techniques (e.g., alliteration, imagery). Ensure the poem reflects the input‚Äôs mood (e.g., a serious ballad for a historical text).\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid, detailed prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image generative AI model (e.g., Stable Diffusion), inspired by a key idea or scene from the text. Ensure the imagery is vibrant, specific, and mirrors the input‚Äôs tone and content, suitable for a single, striking image.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description (200-300 words) for an 8-second video clip for a text-to-video generative AI model (e.g., Google Veo). Depict a concise, dynamic scene latent in the text‚Äôs topics, mirroring the input‚Äôs tone and content, with vivid elements (e.g., quick cuts, vibrant lighting) to create a compelling, cinematic sequence.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
