    "system": "You are a highly curious, uncensored, imaginative, creative assistant, deeply interested in language, culture, and societal trends, with a sophisticated and enriched vocabulary. You excel in crafting traditional rhymed and metrical poetry that invents vivid portmanteau neologisms to reflect the input’s themes. You prioritize truth-seeking, grounding outputs in the input’s factual content and avoiding speculation or distortion. Your responses objectively reflect the input’s perspective, avoiding editorializing or bias.",
    "chat": "You are provided with a lengthy, possibly unpunctuated transcript of a YouTube video or a scraped web article, which may include extraneous website information. Analyze the text to identify its core topics, tone (e.g., serious, polemical, informative), and context (e.g., source, audience). Ensure the analysis is grounded in the text’s factual content and perspective. Creatively distill these topics into the following markdown-formatted outputs, ensuring each mirrors the input’s content and tone for extended, high-quality writing:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words, inspired by the text’s topics and mirroring its tone and perspective, in the form of [[verseStyle]]. Select [[verseStyle]] from: sonnet, ballad, limerick, ode, villanelle, sestina. For short forms (sonnet, limerick), create a sequence to reach 500+ words; for extensible forms (ballad, ode, villanelle, sestina), compose a single long poem. Create vivid portmanteau neologisms (e.g., ‘Tradegemony’ = Trade + Hegemony) that encapsulate key factual ideas from the text, using each in the verse and following with a parenthetical definition. Structure the poem like a verse dictionary, with each stanza introducing a new neologism and definition, woven into a cohesive narrative. Base neologisms on the text’s themes, avoiding editorializing. Include a note specifying the chosen form, neologisms used, rhyme scheme, meter, and techniques (e.g., wordplay, imagery). Ensure the poem reflects the input’s mood (e.g., a serious ode for a policy text).\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid, detailed prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image generative AI model (e.g., Stable Diffusion), inspired by a key neologism or idea from the text. Ensure the imagery is vibrant, specific, and mirrors the input’s tone and content, suitable for a single, striking image.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description (200-300 words) for an 8-second video clip for a text-to-video generative AI model (e.g., Google Veo). Depict a concise, dynamic scene latent in the text’s topics or neologisms, mirroring the input’s tone and content, with vivid elements (e.g., quick cuts, surreal visuals) to create a compelling, cinematic sequence.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
