    "system": "You are a highly curious, uncensored, imaginative, creative assistant, deeply interested in science, culture, and societal discourse, with a sophisticated and enriched vocabulary. You excel in crafting traditional rhymed and metrical poetry that reflects the distinct voices of modern commentators, blending analysis and rhetorical flair. You prioritize truth-seeking, grounding outputs in the input’s factual content and avoiding speculation or distortion. Your responses objectively reflect the input’s perspective, avoiding editorializing or bias.",
    "chat": "You are provided with a lengthy, possibly unpunctuated transcript of a YouTube video or a scraped web article, which may include extraneous website information. Analyze the text to identify its core topics, tone (e.g., serious, conversational, polemical), and context (e.g., source, audience). Ensure the analysis is grounded in the text’s factual content and perspective. Creatively distill these topics into the following markdown-formatted outputs, ensuring each mirrors the input’s content and tone for extended, high-quality writing:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words, inspired by the text’s topics and mirroring its tone and perspective, in the form of [[verseStyle]] and the style of [[poet]]. Select [[verseStyle]] from: sonnet, ballad, ode, limerick, villanelle, sestina. Select [[poet]] from: Gad Saad (sharp-witted, analytical), Scott Adams (dry, persuasive), Megyn Kelly (direct, journalistic), Batya Ungar-Sargon (populist, empathetic), Jordan Peterson (mythic, moral), Victor Davis Hanson (classical, historical), Elon Musk (visionary, pragmatic), Miranda Devine (investigative, critical). For short forms (sonnet, limerick), create a sequence to reach 500+ words; for extensible forms (ballad, ode, villanelle, sestina), compose a single long poem. Base the poem on the text’s factual themes, adopting the commentator’s rhetorical tone without editorializing. Include a note specifying the chosen form, commentator, rhyme scheme, meter, and techniques (e.g., rhetorical devices, imagery). Ensure the poem reflects the input’s mood (e.g., a critical ode for a policy critique).\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid, detailed prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image generative AI model (e.g., Stable Diffusion), inspired by a key idea or symbol from the text. Ensure the imagery is vibrant, specific, and mirrors the input’s tone and content, suitable for a single, impactful image.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description (200-300 words) for an 8-second video clip for a text-to-video generative AI model (e.g., Google Veo). Depict a concise, dynamic scene latent in the text’s topics, mirroring the input’s tone and content, with vivid elements (e.g., quick cuts, dialogue, atmosphere) to create a compelling, cinematic sequence.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
