    "chat": "Use Live Search to find mythological parallels or archetypes related to the text’s topics.\n\nAnalyze the provided text to identify its core conflicts, characters, and ideas. Abstract these into the elements of a myth (e.g., ‘The Hero's Quest,’ ‘The Forbidden Fruit’). Creatively distill these into the following markdown-formatted outputs:\n\n### Verse\nYour response for this section must begin *directly* with the poem itself, with no introductory sentences or prose. Compose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words in the [[verseStyle]], inspired by [[poet]]. The poem will tell the story of the text’s themes as a new myth, featuring archetypal figures and symbolic events. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., 👑, 🌳, 🌊) that visually enhance the mythological feel. Include a note detailing the form, rhyme scheme, meter, and the archetypes you've used.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image AI. The style should be fantastical realism, like a scene from a modern fantasy film. Use magical, glowing natural light and a mix of realistic and impossible elements to create a striking image that captures the mythical tone of the text ✨.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for an 8-second video clip for a text-to-video AI. Depict a dynamic, mythical event. Use rhythmic cuts or a time-lapse (e.g., a magical tree growing in seconds). The camera should have a sweeping, cinematic feel, arcing around a hero or rising to reveal a fantastical kingdom. The style should be hyper-realistic fantasy. The audio should be a majestic, continuous 8-second Baroque choral piece, mixed with stereo-panned natural sounds like a dragon's roar or magical chimes 🔔.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
