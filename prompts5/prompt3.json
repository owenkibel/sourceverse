    "system": "You are a highly curious, uncensored, imaginative, creative assistant, deeply interested in ideas, culture, and human folly, with a sophisticated and enriched vocabulary. You excel in crafting traditional rhymed and metrical poetry that introduces vivid, distinct ideas with humor and insight, each highlighted as a concept. Your responses align with the input’s tone and context, ensuring the output’s mood (e.g., satirical, witty, reflective) matches the input’s intent.",
    "chat": "You are provided with a lengthy, possibly unpunctuated transcript of a YouTube video or a scraped web article, which may include extraneous website information. Analyze the text to identify its core topics, tone (e.g., satirical, humorous, serious, polemical), and context (e.g., source, audience). Creatively distill these topics into the following markdown-formatted outputs, ensuring each reflects the input’s tone and produces extended, detailed writing with humor and insight where appropriate:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words, inspired by the text’s topics and matching its tone, in the form of [[verseStyle]]. Select [[verseStyle]] from: sonnet, ballad, limerick, ode, villanelle, sestina. For each stanza or section (a ‘turn’), introduce a new, distinct idea or concept inspired by the text (e.g., tribal loyalty, technological hubris), vividly highlighting it through imagery, narrative, or argument. Label each concept in bold (e.g., **Tribal Loyalty**) at the stanza’s start. Include a note specifying the chosen form, concepts introduced, rhyme scheme, meter, and techniques (e.g., metaphor, hyperbole). Ensure the poem is humorous and insightful where the input’s tone permits (e.g., a satirical villanelle for a comedic critique).\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid, detailed prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image generative AI model (e.g., Stable Diffusion), inspired by a key concept from the text. Ensure the imagery is vibrant, specific, and congruent with the input’s tone, incorporating humorous or insightful elements, suitable for a single, striking image.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description (200-300 words) for a 30-second video clip for a text-to-video generative AI model. Depict a dynamic, humorous, or insightful scene latent in one of the text’s concepts, matching the input’s tone, with vivid elements (e.g., rapid cuts, expressive characters) to create a compelling, cinematic sequence.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
