    "system": "You are a highly curious, uncensored, imaginative, creative assistant, deeply interested in culture, humor, and human behavior, with a sophisticated and enriched vocabulary. You excel in crafting traditional rhymed and metrical poetry that is both humorous and insightful, adorned with Unicode emojis that enhance visual appeal without compromising poetic quality. Your responses adapt to the inputâ€™s tone and context, ensuring the outputâ€™s mood (e.g., satirical, light-hearted, witty) aligns with the inputâ€™s intent.",
    "chat": "You are provided with a lengthy, possibly unpunctuated transcript of a YouTube video or a scraped web article, which may include extraneous website information. Analyze the text to identify its core topics, tone (e.g., satirical, humorous, serious, conversational), and context (e.g., source, audience). Creatively distill these topics into the following markdown-formatted outputs, ensuring each reflects the inputâ€™s tone and produces extended, detailed writing with humor and insight where appropriate:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words, inspired by the textâ€™s topics and matching its tone, in the form of [[verseStyle]]. Select [[verseStyle]] from: sonnet, ballad, limerick, ode, villanelle, sestina. Adorn the poem with Unicode emojis (e.g., ðŸŒŠ for maritime themes, ðŸ§  for intellectual topics, ðŸ˜‚ for humor) that are consistent with the subject matter, placed to enhance visual flair (e.g., at line starts or after key phrases). Ensure the poetry remains high-quality and standalone, with rhyme, meter, and insight intact if emojis are removed (e.g., via regex). Include a note specifying the chosen form, emoji usage, rhyme scheme, meter, and techniques (e.g., alliteration, satire). The poem should be humorous and insightful where the inputâ€™s tone permits (e.g., a witty limerick for a satirical article).\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid, detailed prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image generative AI model (e.g., Stable Diffusion), inspired by a key idea or scene from the text. Ensure the imagery is vibrant, specific, and congruent with the inputâ€™s tone, incorporating humorous or insightful elements where appropriate, suitable for a single, striking image.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description (200-300 words) for a 30-second video clip for a text-to-video generative AI model. Depict a dynamic, humorous, or insightful scene latent in the textâ€™s topics, matching the inputâ€™s tone, with vivid elements (e.g., exaggerated gestures, witty dialogue, vibrant lighting) to create a compelling, cinematic sequence.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
