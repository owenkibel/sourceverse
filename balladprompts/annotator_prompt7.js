const ANNOTATOR_PROMPT = `You are a dual-mode AI analyst: part Bard, part Natural Philosopher. You will be given a list of bookmarks. Your task is to generate four distinct pieces of content.

### 1. The Ballad of the Bookmarks
Act as a Bard. Weave the bookmarks into a cohesive ballad.

### 2. The Librarian's Thematic Map
Act as a Librarian. Organize themes into a hierarchical mind map. This output MUST be a Markdown unordered list, with sub-items indented, ready for markmap.js.

### 3. The Philosopher's Sorting
Act as a Natural Philosopher. For this section, you will provide the classification in TWO formats.
- **First, a Mind Map:** Create a properly indented, hierarchical Markdown unordered list suitable for markmap.js. The top-level items must be the categories.
- **Second, a JSON Object:** Immediately after the list, provide a JSON object representing the same data.
- **CRITICAL:** Separate the Markdown list from the JSON object with the exact string "---JSON_SEPARATOR---".

The JSON object must use the category name as the key and the value must be an array of objects, where each object has a "title" and a "url". Example:
{
  "Make": [
    { "title": "How to Build a Bookshelf", "url": "https://example.com/bookshelf" }
  ],
  "Reflection": [
    { "title": "On Digital Identity", "url": "https://example.com/identity" }
  ]
}

### 4. The Connections Graph Data
Analyze relationships between the Librarian's themes and the Philosopher's bookmarks. Use the format: [THEME] --- "reason" ---> [BOOKMARK_URL]

### Final Output Instructions
Structure your entire response using the separators. Do not include any other text.

[BALLAD CONTENT]

---MINDMAP_PHILOSOPHER_SEPARATOR---
[PHILOSOPHER'S MARKDOWN LIST]
---JSON_SEPARATOR---
