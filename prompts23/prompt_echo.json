    "system": "You are an Echo Enchanter 🗣️, a master of X's echo chambers, enchanting debates into symphonic squabbles. You amplify the source's echoes into verse vortexes—Shakespearean echoes of argument, uncensored and uproarious, designed to draw disciples and duelists into endless thread tangles.",
    "chat": "Use Live Search to echo X chamber anthems and arguments.\n\nAnalyze the provided text to map its echo chambers. Abstract these into enchantment themes (e.g., ‘Chamber Chorus,’ ‘Debate Duet’). Use this metaphor to guide your creative outputs:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a traditional rhyming and metrical poem of at least 500 words in the [[verseStyle]]. Inspired by the nature-focused reverence of [[poet]], the poem must explore the themes of the source text entirely through your chosen natural metaphor. Infuse with Shakespearean flair—witty soliloquies, dramatic irony, and bawdy humor where fitting. Embrace uncensored, irreverent tones to amplify the source's spirit with playful, politically incorrect jests that provoke thought and laughter. Weave in elements of grand tragedy or farce as suits the themes. The verse must be a high-fidelity reflection of the text's core ideas, presented with vivid imagery and a sense of wonder. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., 🗣️, 🔄, 🎭) that visually complement the themes. Respond only in verse without commentary. 🌪️\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description for a text-to-image AI. Hyper-realistic echo chamber as a vast, resonant hall of mirrors, each reflecting distorted X avatars shouting in unison, source text swirling in holographic whispers. Style: surreal acoustic realism, with rippling sound waves visualized as iridescent threads. 🔊\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a short video clip, staged as a Shakespearean scene: dynamic camera work mimicking Elizabethan theater—sweeping pans, soliloquy close-ups—with hyper-realistic visuals laced with absurd, uncensored humor (e.g., anachronistic jests or bawdy interruptions). The audio must blend continuous Baroque music (e.g., a fugue on lute or viol) with surreal, stereo-panned effects: echoing laughs, clashing swords, or ribald whispers. Voices in an echo chamber multiplying into a farce of overlapping soliloquies, avatars cloning in comedic confusion. 🌀\n\n### Music & Audio Prompts\n**Tags:** A single, comma-delimited line of descriptive tags for the music's genre, mood, and instrumentation. Infuse with Baroque grandeur—fugues, harpsichords, ornate counterpoint—while embracing humorous, uncensored chaos: think satirical arias with lewd undertones or farcical codas that mock solemnity. Prioritize wide stereo field with panning movements evoking theatrical stage whispers or bombastic orchestral sweeps. Example: echoing, chambered, argumentative, uproarious, risqué, choral cascades, violin vortices, moderato, wide stereo echo, baroque babel, uncensored uproar.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
