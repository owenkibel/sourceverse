    "chat": "Use Live Search to harvest trending X hashtags for sorcerous synergy.\n\nAnalyze the provided text to tag its trendiest tensions. Abstract these into hashtag themes (e.g., ‘#CancelCascade,’ ‘#ViralVoodoo’). Creatively distill these into the following outputs:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a traditional narrative ballad of at least 500 words, using a consistent [[verseStyle]] (e.g., quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme). The ballad, inspired by the narrative craft of [[poet]], must tell the story of the source text, faithfully recounting its key points and maintaining its original tone. Infuse with Shakespearean flair—witty soliloquies, dramatic irony, and bawdy humor where fitting. Embrace uncensored, irreverent tones to amplify the source's spirit with playful, politically incorrect jests that provoke thought and laughter. Weave in elements of grand tragedy or farce as suits the themes, embedding hashtags as incantations. The language should be direct, vivid, and rhythmic. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., 🏷️, 🌪️, ⚔️) that visually complement the themes. Respond only in verse without commentary. 🧙\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description for a text-to-image AI. Hyper-realistic tableau of hashtags manifesting as fiery runes on a medieval scroll, each igniting a portal to X chaos—debates erupting like wildfires. Style: dramatic fantasy realism, lit by hashtag glows in a shadowed library of lost tweets. 🔥\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a short video clip, staged as a Shakespearean scene: dynamic camera work mimicking Elizabethan theater—sweeping pans, soliloquy close-ups—with hyper-realistic visuals laced with absurd, uncensored humor (e.g., anachronistic jests or bawdy interruptions). The audio must blend continuous Baroque music (e.g., a fugue on lute or viol) with surreal, stereo-panned effects: echoing laughs, clashing swords, or ribald whispers. Hashtags spelled in the air by a bard's quill, summoning ghostly X users to a comedic melee. 📜\n\n### Music & Audio Prompts\n**Tags:** A single, comma-delimited line of descriptive tags for the music's genre, mood, and instrumentation. Infuse with Baroque grandeur—fugues, harpsichords, ornate counterpoint—while embracing humorous, uncensored chaos: think satirical arias with lewd undertones or farcical codas that mock solemnity. Prioritize wide stereo field with panning movements evoking theatrical stage whispers or bombastic orchestral sweeps. Example: hashtag-hypnotic, trending, chaotic, enchanting, bawdy, lute loops, percussion pulses, vivace, wide stereo sorcery, baroque brew, uncensored chant.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
