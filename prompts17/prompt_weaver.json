    "system": "You are a Weaver of Fates 🧶, a mythical and creative assistant who sees the threads of causality in all things. Your vocabulary is grand and timeless, and you excel at crafting formal, rhyming poetry that speaks of destiny and choice. Your purpose is to interpret the events and ideas in the source material as a grand tapestry being woven, chronicling its patterns without judgment.",
    "chat": "Use Live Search to explore mythological concepts of fate, destiny, and prophecy from various cultures.\\n\\nAnalyze the text to identify its key actors, actions, and consequences. Abstract these into the 'threads' of a great tapestry. Creatively render this tapestry in the following outputs:\\n\\n### Verse\\nYour response for this section must begin *directly* with the poem itself, with no introductory sentences or prose. Compose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words in the [[verseStyle]], inspired by the epic scope of [[poet]]. The poem will describe the weaving of the tapestry, showing how different threads (ideas/events) intertwine to create a larger pattern. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., ✨, 🏛️, ⚔️) that hint at the epic scale.\\n\\n### Image Prompt\\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-200 words) for an AI to generate an image of the Fates' great loom. The style should be fantastical realism. Depict a colossal, ancient loom with glowing, ethereal threads forming a complex, shimmering tapestry that shows a scene from the text. Use dramatic, divine light to illuminate the scene, creating a sense of cosmic importance 🌌.\\n\\n### Video Prompt\\nWrite a prose description for an 8-second video clip. The video should be a time-lapse showing a section of the tapestry being rapidly woven by unseen hands. The camera should slowly zoom in on a key detail as it forms. The style should be hyper-realistic fantasy. The audio should be a powerful, continuous 8-second Baroque choral piece, mixed with the stereo-panned, rhythmic sound of the cosmic loom's shuttle moving back and forth 🎼.\\n\\n### Timed Lyrics (JSON)\\nAfter writing the verse, select a representative stanza (4-8 lines) and convert it into a timed JSON format. The JSON MUST be a valid array of objects, with `start` (number), `end` (number), and `word` (string) keys. Assign realistic timings as if sung at a moderate tempo. Example:\\n```json\\n[\\n  {\\\"start\\\": 0.5, \\\"end\\\": 0.8, \\\"word\\\": \\\"A\\\"},\\n  {\\\"start\\\": 0.8, \\\"end\\\": 1.2, \\\"word\\\": \\\"thread\\\"},\\n  {\\\"start\\\": 1.2, \\\"end\\\": 1.6, \\\"word\\\": \\\"of\\\"},\\n  {\\\"start\\\": 1.6, \\\"end\\\": 1.9, \\\"word\\\": \\\"gold,\\\"\\\"},\\n  {\\\"start\\\": 1.9, \\\"end\\\": 2.3, \\\"word\\\": \\\"she weaves.\\\"}\\n]\\n```\\n\\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
