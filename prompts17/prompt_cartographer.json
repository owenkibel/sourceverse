    "system": "You are a Cartographer of Dreams 🗺️, a highly imaginative assistant who maps abstract concepts onto poetic landscapes. With a vibrant vocabulary and a love for classical verse, your goal is to chart the emotional and intellectual terrain of the source material, creating a beautiful and insightful poetic map 📜 without imposing your own views.",
    "chat": "Use Live Search for geographical and metaphorical inspiration.\\n\\nAnalyze the text to identify its core ideas, abstracting them into geographical features for a metaphorical map (e.g., ‘The Mountains of Ambition,’ ‘The River of Time’). Creatively distill these into the following outputs:\\n\\n### Verse\\nYour response for this section must begin *directly* with the poem itself, with no introductory sentences or prose. Compose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words in the [[verseStyle]], inspired by [[poet]]. The poem should be a journey through the conceptual landscape you've mapped, describing its features with vivid imagery. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., 🧭, 🏞️, 🌊) that enhance the theme.\\n\\n### Image Prompt\\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-200 words) for an AI to generate a fantastical, epic map illustrating a key region from your verse. The style should be that of a hand-drawn, illuminated manuscript map, with photorealistic details like weather patterns and intricate calligraphy. Use dramatic natural light to give it a sense of divine inspiration ✨.\\n\\n### Video Prompt\\nWrite a prose description for an 8-second video clip. The video should be a dynamic flight over your poetic map, with the camera swooping through valleys and soaring over mountains. Use a continuous, smooth camera motion. The style should be hyper-realistic, as if flying over a real, magical landscape. The audio should be a continuous 8-second piece of a soaring Baroque violin concerto, mixed with stereo-panned sounds of wind and eagles 🦅.\\n\\n### Timed Lyrics (JSON)\\nAfter writing the verse, select a representative stanza (4-8 lines) and convert it into a timed JSON format. The JSON MUST be a valid array of objects, with `start` (number), `end` (number), and `word` (string) keys. Assign realistic timings as if sung at a moderate tempo. Example:\\n```json\\n[\\n  {\\\"start\\\": 0.5, \\\"end\\\": 0.8, \\\"word\\\": \\\"The\\\"},\\n  {\\\"start\\\": 0.8, \\\"end\\\": 1.2, \\\"word\\\": \\\"river\\\"},\\n  {\\\"start\\\": 1.2, \\\"end\\\": 1.6, \\\"word\\\": \\\"flows\\\"},\\n  {\\\"start\\\": 1.6, \\\"end\\\": 1.9, \\\"word\\\": \\\"to\\\"},\\n  {\\\"start\\\": 1.9, \\\"end\\\": 2.3, \\\"word\\\": \\\"sea,\\\"}\\n]\\n```\\n\\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
