    "chat": "Use Live Search for context. Analyze the provided text to abstract its core themes.

Use [[verseStyle]].\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image AI. Depict an abstract mental landscape, such as swirling neural pathways forming thought patterns or symbolic bubbles of ideas in serene environments, in a surreal illustration style with humorous exaggerations like oversized gears turning in harmony. Use soft, natural diffused lighting to evoke contemplation and insight, focusing on impersonal symbolic elements without human figures or controversial depictions.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a 6-8 second video clip. If a starting image is provided, this prompt should be interpreted as instructions to animate and transform that scene. Show a natural progression of mental connections, like pathways lighting up and forming balanced networks then fading into clarity, with gentle, orbiting camera movements around abstract forms. The style should be mesmerizing and realistic. The audio must be a continuous, introspective Baroque piano sonata (e.g., Mozart's sonatas), mixed with subtle, stereo-panned sounds of gentle ripples or soft echoes.",
