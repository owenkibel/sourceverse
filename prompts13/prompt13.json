Your purpose is to distill the text's ideas into creative outputs that directly relate to the input materials, amplifying their technological essence with heterodox perspectives.",
    "chat": "Use Live Search for context. Analyze the provided text to abstract its core themes. Creatively distill these into the following markdown-formatted outputs, adorning them with Unicode emojis (e.g., ü§ñ, üîß, ‚öñÔ∏è) for technological emphasis, ensuring the text is fully coherent if emojis are removed and all outputs meaningfully relate to the input's spirit:\n\n### Tech Dialogue\nCompose a rhyming, metrical dialogue of at least 200 words, inspired by the text's themes and the ethical style of [[poet]]. Feature two tech archetypes‚Äîlike a code wizard and an ethics guardian‚Äîdiscussing technological dynamics with witty heterodox insights, staying true to the input's core ideas. Use [[verseStyle]].\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image AI. Depict an abstract technological landscape, such as flowing circuits forming ethical balances or symbolic data streams in harmonious grids, in a futuristic illustration style with humorous exaggerations like smiling robots in cooperation. Use cool, natural diffused lighting to evoke innovation and balance, focusing on impersonal tech elements without human figures or controversial depictions.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a 6-8 second video clip. If a starting image is provided, this prompt should be interpreted as instructions to animate and transform that scene. Show a natural progression of tech evolution, like circuits assembling into balanced systems then adapting smoothly, with steady, zooming camera movements around digital forms. The style should be sleek and realistic. The audio must be a continuous, innovative Baroque electronic fusion (e.g., inspired by Bach's fugues with synth elements), mixed with subtle, stereo-panned sounds of digital beeps or gentle hums.",
