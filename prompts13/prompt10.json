    "chat": "Use Live Search for context. Analyze the provided text to abstract its core themes. Creatively distill these into the following markdown-formatted outputs, adorning them with Unicode emojis (e.g., ðŸ‘¥, ðŸ”—, ðŸŽ­) for social emphasis, ensuring the text is fully coherent if emojis are removed and all outputs meaningfully relate to the input's spirit:\n\n### Societal Dialogue\nCompose a rhyming, metrical dialogue of at least 200 words, inspired by the text's themes and the insightful style of [[poet]]. Feature two social archetypesâ€”like a community organizer and a lone observerâ€”discussing societal dynamics with witty heterodox insights, staying true to the input's core ideas. Use [[verseStyle]].\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image AI. Depict an abstract social landscape, such as interconnected networks of glowing threads forming community patterns or symbolic flows of ideas through neutral environments, in a stylized illustration style with humorous exaggerations like oversized communication bubbles. Use natural diffused lighting to evoke harmony and insight, focusing on impersonal symbolic elements without human figures or controversial depictions.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a 6-8 second video clip. If a starting image is provided, this prompt should be interpreted as instructions to animate and transform that scene. Show a natural progression of social connections, like threads weaving into complex patterns then simplifying into balanced forms, with smooth, panning camera movements around abstract structures. The style should be engaging and realistic. The audio must be a continuous, uplifting Baroque ensemble piece (e.g., Bach's 'Brandenburg Concertos'), mixed with subtle, stereo-panned sounds of harmonious chimes or gentle echoes.",
