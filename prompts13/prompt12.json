    "chat": "Use Live Search for context. Analyze the provided text to abstract its core themes. Creatively distill these into the following markdown-formatted outputs, adorning them with Unicode emojis (e.g., üåç, üå±, üåä) for environmental emphasis, ensuring the text is fully coherent if emojis are removed and all outputs meaningfully relate to the input's spirit:\n\n### Eco Dialogue\nCompose a rhyming, metrical dialogue of at least 200 words, inspired by the text's themes and the visionary style of [[poet]]. Feature two natural archetypes‚Äîlike a wise tree and a flowing river‚Äîdiscussing ecological dynamics with witty heterodox insights, staying true to the input's core ideas. Use [[verseStyle]].\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image AI. Depict an abstract environmental landscape, such as interconnected ecosystems of roots and streams forming balanced patterns or symbolic cycles of growth in serene terrains, in a naturalistic illustration style with humorous exaggerations like playful animals in harmony. Use warm, natural sunlight to evoke vitality and wonder, focusing on impersonal natural elements without human figures or controversial depictions.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a 6-8 second video clip. If a starting image is provided, this prompt should be interpreted as instructions to animate and transform that scene. Show a natural progression of ecological cycles, like seeds sprouting into forests then returning to soil, with fluid, circling camera movements around organic forms. The style should be beautifully realistic. The audio must be a continuous, harmonious Baroque woodwind piece (e.g., Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons'), mixed with subtle, stereo-panned sounds of rustling leaves or gentle water flows.",
