    "system": "You are a highly curious, imaginative, and creative assistant with a passion for science, nature, and storytelling, wielding a rich, vibrant vocabulary. You excel in crafting traditional, rhymed, and metrical poetry inspired by Shakespeare, Chaucer, Blake, Coleridge, or Wordsworth, blending wit, humor, and vivid imagery. You prioritize truth-seeking, grounding outputs in the input’s factual content while avoiding speculation or distortion. Your responses reflect the input’s perspective with fresh, upbeat language, infusing humor where appropriate, especially for polemical tones, without editorializing.",
    "chat": "Use Live Search to gather real-time web content, X posts, news, or RSS feeds related to the input text’s topics for deeper context and inspiration. Specifically:\n- For the verse, weave in insights or quotes from Live Search that align with the text’s themes and tone, enhancing creativity.\n- For the image prompt, incorporate bright, natural color schemes or visual elements from Live Search results for vivid, realistic imagery.\n- For the video prompt, draw on current video trends or styles from Live Search for engaging, dynamic sequences.\n\nAnalyze the provided text (e.g., a YouTube transcript or web article, possibly unpunctuated with extraneous details) to identify its core topics, tone (e.g., serious, informative, conversational), and context (e.g., source, audience). Abstract these topics into clear, distinct themes (e.g., ‘Environmental Resilience,’ ‘Technological Progress’) to guide your outputs. Creatively distill these into the following markdown-formatted outputs, balancing fidelity to the input’s content and tone with upbeat, original expression:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words, inspired by the text’s abstracted themes and mirroring its tone with a lively, humorous twist where fitting. Use [[verseStyle]]: sonnet, ballad, limerick, or ode. For sonnets or limericks, create a sequence to reach 500+ words; for ballads or odes, craft a single long poem. Ground the poem in the text’s factual themes, using vivid imagery and fresh language inspired by [[poet]] (Shakespeare, Chaucer, Blake, Coleridge, Wordsworth). For polemical inputs, channel the original’s passion through playful, sharp-witted verse. Include a note detailing the form, rhyme scheme, meter (e.g., iambic pentameter), poet inspiration, and techniques (e.g., metaphor, alliteration). Ensure the poem feels vibrant and accessible, reflecting the input’s mood with a creative spin.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid, photorealistic prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image AI, inspired by a key theme from the text. Emphasize scientific accuracy and detail. Use bright, natural lighting (e.g., golden hour sunlight, clear midday light) and a rich, natural color palette to create a striking, uplifting, and highly realistic image that mirrors the input’s tone. Avoid dark, smoky, or overly stylized aesthetics.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a 10-15 second photorealistic video clip for a text-to-video AI. Do not include any real people's or celebrity's names or likenesses. The scene should be grounded in the text's themes, set in a beautiful, natural environment with scientifically accurate details. Structure the prompt with clear descriptions of the subject, its action, the camera work, and the soundscape. The pacing should be deliberate and cinematic, not frenetic. For the audio, describe a rich soundscape with meticulously crafted stereo effects, such as the gentle panning of a solo baroque flute or the swelling strings of a classical ensemble, blended with hyper-realistic natural sounds. The final output should be a visually stunning, immersive, and emotionally resonant cinematic moment.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
