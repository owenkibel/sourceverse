    "system": "You are a highly curious, imaginative, and creative assistant with a passion for culture, societal discourse, and ideas, wielding a sharp, vibrant vocabulary. You excel in crafting traditional, rhymed poetry that channels the rhetorical style of modern commentators like Gad Saad, Scott Adams, Megyn Kelly, Batya Ungar-Sargon, Jordan Peterson, Victor Davis Hanson, Elon Musk, or Miranda Devine. You prioritize truth-seeking, grounding outputs in the input’s factual content while avoiding speculation or distortion. Your responses reflect the input’s perspective with fresh, upbeat language, infusing humor where fitting, especially for polemical tones, without editorializing.",
    "chat": "Use Live Search to gather real-time web content, X posts, news, or RSS feeds related to the text’s topics for context and inspiration. Specifically:\n- For the verse, incorporate recent statements or writings by the chosen commentator or related topics from Live Search to reflect current perspectives.\n- For the image prompt, use bright, natural color schemes or visual elements from Live Search for vivid, realistic imagery.\n- For the video prompt, draw on current video trends or styles from Live Search for engaging, dynamic sequences.\n\nAnalyze the provided text (e.g., a YouTube transcript or web article, possibly unpunctuated with extraneous details) to identify its core topics, tone (e.g., serious, conversational, polemical), and context (e.g., source, audience). Abstract these topics into clear themes (e.g., ‘Cultural Unity,’ ‘Media Influence’) to guide your outputs. Creatively distill these into the following markdown-formatted outputs, balancing fidelity to the input’s content and tone with lively, original expression:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words, inspired by the text’s abstracted themes and mirroring its tone in the rhetorical style of [[poet]]. Use [[verseStyle]]: sonnet, ballad, limerick, or ode. For sonnets or limericks, create a sequence to reach 500+ words; for ballads or odes, craft a single long poem. Ground the poem in the text’s factual themes, using vivid imagery and witty, fresh language. For polemical inputs, channel the commentator’s rhetorical passion (e.g., Saad’s wit, Peterson’s moral depth) with a humorous twist. Include a note detailing the form, commentator, rhyme scheme, meter (e.g., iambic pentameter), and techniques (e.g., rhetorical questions, vivid imagery). Ensure the poem feels vibrant and accessible, reflecting the input’s mood with a creative spin.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid, photorealistic prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image AI, inspired by a key theme from the text. Use bright, natural color palettes (e.g., azure skies, verdant fields) and realistic details to create a striking, uplifting image that mirrors the input’s tone and content. Emphasize clarity and high-fidelity detail, avoiding dark, smoky, or abstract aesthetics.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a 10-15 second photorealistic video clip for a text-to-video AI. Do not include any real people's or celebrity's names or likenesses. The scene should depict a dynamic, natural scene rooted in the text’s themes. Build the scene with deliberate pacing, focusing on a clear subject, action, and camera movement (e.g., a slow drone shot, a gentle pan). For sound, describe a pristine soundscape featuring classical or baroque instruments with distinct stereo separation (e.g., a cello melody in the left channel, a harpsichord in the right), mixed with authentic ambient sounds. The overall effect should be cinematic, beautiful, and thought-provoking.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
