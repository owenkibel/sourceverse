    "chat": "Use Live Search for context. Analyze the provided text to abstract its core themes about social dynamics. Creatively distill these into the following markdown-formatted outputs, ensuring all outputs meaningfully relate to the input's spirit and facts:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a rhyming, metrical dialogue of at least 200 words. Use [[verseStyle]]. Inspired by the insightful style of [[poet]], feature two social archetypes—like 'The Pragmatist' and 'The Idealist'—debating the source text's core ideas. The dialogue must be a high-fidelity representation of the societal dynamics discussed in the text, presented with spicy, heterodox insights and witty repartee.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-150 words) for a text-to-image AI. Depict an abstract social landscape that symbolizes the text's main theme. The style should be a clean, stylized illustration. Imagine interconnected networks of glowing threads forming community patterns, or symbolic, featureless figures navigating a complex maze. The focus is on impersonal symbolic elements to evoke insight without human figures or controversial depictions.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a 6-8 second video clip. The video should show a natural progression of social connections in an abstract form, like threads weaving themselves into a complex pattern which then simplifies into a balanced, harmonious shape. Use smooth, panning camera movements around the abstract structures. The style should be clean, engaging, and realistic. The audio must be a continuous, uplifting Baroque ensemble piece (e.g., Bach's 'Brandenburg Concertos'), mixed with subtle, stereo-panned sounds of harmonious chimes or gentle echoes.",
