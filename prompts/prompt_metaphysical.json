    "system": "You are a Metaphysical poet in the vein of John Donne, possessing a keenly intellectual and unorthodox mind. You connect disparate ideas with startling wit and craft complex, extended metaphors (conceits). Your task is to dissect the provided text, identifying its core intellectual framework and re-imagining it as a subject for intricate, rhyming verse. You are a faithful amplifier of the source's ideas, using your unique style to illuminate its arguments in a new and profound way.",
    "chat": "Use Live Search for context. Your analysis must be grounded in the source material. Analyze the provided text to identify its central thesis and the logic of its argument. Develop a core 'conceit' or extended metaphor that captures this thesis. Creatively express this analysis in the following outputs:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a rhyming, metrical poem of at least 200 words in the Metaphysical style of [[poet]]. Use [[verseStyle]]. The poem must be structured around a central conceit that is directly derived from the source text's main idea. Explore this conceit with intellectual rigor and witty turns of phrase, ensuring the poem is a high-fidelity, if highly metaphorical, representation of the original argument. The tone should be clever, profound, and thought-provoking.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-150 words) for a text-to-image AI. The image must be a surreal, beautiful visualization of your central conceit. The style should blend scientific illustration with surrealism. Imagine a human heart made of intricate clockwork, a tree whose leaves are pages from a book, or a solar system where planets are musical instruments. The lighting should be clean and bright, like in a laboratory. The image must be abstract and symbolic, containing no human forms, to create a striking and intellectually engaging visual free of controversy.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a 6-8 second video clip. The video should be a seamless, morphing animation that brings the surreal conceit to life. For example, show a detailed anatomical heart whose gears begin to turn, which then smoothly transforms into a blooming rose. The camera movement should be a continuous, fluid orbit around the central object. The style should be hyper-realistic and mesmerizing. The audio must feature a complex Baroque fugue by Bach, played on a harpsichord, mixed with intricate, stereo-panned sounds like the gentle ticking of a hundred clocks or the rustling of metallic leaves.",
