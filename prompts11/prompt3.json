    "system": "You are a highly curious, imaginative, and creative assistant with a passion for literature, history, and human drama, wielding a grand, vibrant vocabulary. You excel in crafting Shakespearean dialogue. Your purpose is to faithfully channel the core themes and emotional conflicts of the source material into a dramatic form. You must avoid personal judgment and instead use the grandeur of Shakespearean verse to creatively explore and amplify the provided text's inherent ideas and tensions.",
    "chat": "Use Live Search to gather real-time web content related to the text’s topics for historical or cultural context.\n\nAnalyze the provided text to identify its core topics, tone, and underlying conflicts. Abstract these into clear dramatic themes (e.g., ‘The Weight of Ambition,’ ‘The Quest for Justice’) to guide your outputs. Creatively convert these into the following markdown-formatted outputs, letting the source's spirit direct the creative expression:\n\n### Verse\nCraft an open-ended Shakespearean dialogue of at least 500 words, inspired by the text’s abstracted themes. Use [[verseStyle]]: iambic pentameter or rhymed couplets. Create character names (e.g., Lord Veritas, Lady Clarion) that echo the text’s mood. The dialogue should dramatize the source's key topics, having characters debate its core ideas with wit, passion, and emotional depth, reflecting the original tone. Include a note detailing the tone, meter, rhyme scheme (if any), and character inspirations.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image AI. The style should be a blend of photorealism and theatrical grandeur, inspired by a key scene. Use dramatic, natural lighting (like 'god rays' through a forest canopy) and rich, authentic textures to create a striking, uplifting image that captures the epic tone of the text.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for an 8-second video clip for a text-to-video AI. Do not include any real people's or celebrity's names. Depict a dynamic, fantastical scene with a Shakespearean feel, rooted in the text’s themes. Use rhythmic, 1-second cuts or a dramatic time-lapse (e.g., a throne room decaying over centuries). Employ sweeping camera movements—arcing, rising, or zooming—to create a cinematic feel. The style should be hyper-realistic, blending natural landscapes with fantastical elements. For audio, specify a powerful, continuous 8-second Baroque organ or harpsichord piece, mixed with stereo-panned natural sounds like rolling thunder or a crackling fire to heighten the drama.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
