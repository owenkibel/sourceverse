@/home/owen/sourceverse/bookmarksimage9.js      Consider this place in the code:  await fs.writeFile(lastTimestampFile, newestTimestamp.toString());
        console.log(`Processed ${newBookmarks.length} new bookmarks, updated timestamp to ${newestTimestamp}`);      At present the script will create markdown output for a bookmarks file of any length. This is impractical for a subsequent generative AI script which works best when the number of bookmarks is less than 50. Modify the script to evaluate newBookmarks.length.  If the number of new bookmarks is 50 or less then perform the entire script in one go. 35 is about the optimum number of bookmarks. If there are more new bookmarks than 50 then divide the total number by 35 to determine the total number of iterations of the script, updating the timestamp file each time until the timestamp file is current. The last iteration of the script will produce output that likely has fewer than 35 bookmarks as the remainder.
