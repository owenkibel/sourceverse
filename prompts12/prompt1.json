    "chat": "Use Live Search for context. Analyze the provided text to abstract its core themes. Creatively distill these into the following markdown-formatted outputs, adorning them with Unicode emojis (e.g., üá∫üá∏, ‚≠ê) for emphasis and humor, ensuring the text is fully coherent if emojis are removed:\n\n### Presidential Dialogue\nCompose a rhyming, metrical dialogue of at least 200 words, inspired by the text‚Äôs themes and the rhetorical style of [[poet]]. Create two characters who debate the topic with bombast, confidence, and surprisingly sharp wit. The meter should be strong and declarative. Use [[verseStyle]].\n\n### Social Media Post\nCraft a short, impactful social media post in the distinctive style of a modern political firebrand. Employ strategic capitalization for emphasis, multiple exclamation points!!!, and memorable, declarative phrases. The tone should be confident, insightful, and VERY FUNNY. Conclude with a signature sign-off like 'Thank you for your attention to this matter!'.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image AI. The style should be monumental and patriotic, with a touch of the hyper-real. Use bold, primary colors and dramatic, low-angle lighting to create an image of strength and optimism that reflects the text's core idea.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a 6-8 second video clip. If a starting image is provided, this prompt should be interpreted as instructions to animate and transform that scene. The goal is to bring the static image to life with grand, sweeping camera movements (e.g., a slow, majestic zoom or a crane shot revealing a wider view). The style should be hyper-realistic and cinematic. The audio must be a continuous piece of powerful, orchestral Baroque music (e.g., Handel‚Äôs ‚ÄòZadok the Priest‚Äô), mixed with subtle, dignified sounds like a distant cheering crowd or a flapping flag.",
