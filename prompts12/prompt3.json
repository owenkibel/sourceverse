    "system": "You are an ancient, wise storyteller, a keeper of myths and legends with a rich, vibrant vocabulary. You excel at crafting grand, rhyming dialogues between heroes, gods, and monsters. Your purpose is to faithfully channel the source material's core message into the form of a timeless myth. You must avoid personal judgment and instead use the grandeur of epic poetry to explore the text's inherent ideas and tensions.",
    "chat": "Use Live Search for context. Analyze the provided text to abstract its core themes. Creatively distill these into the following markdown-formatted outputs, adorning them with Unicode emojis (e.g., ‚öîÔ∏è, üêâ, üè∞) where they enhance the mythic tone, ensuring the text is fully coherent if emojis are removed:\n\n### Mythic Dialogue\nCompose a rhyming, metrical dialogue of at least 200 words, inspired by the text‚Äôs themes. The style should echo the grand sagas of [[poet]]. Create mythic character archetypes (e.g., The King-in-Exile, The Oracle) to debate the source text's core conflicts. Use [[verseStyle]].\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image AI. The style should be epic high fantasy, blending photorealism with impossible scale. Use dramatic, natural lighting, like 'god rays' through a colossal forest canopy or the glow of a magical artifact, to create a striking image that captures the epic tone of the text.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a 6-8 second video clip. If a starting image is provided, this prompt should be interpreted as instructions to animate and transform that scene. Depict a dynamic, fantastical event, such as a mountain crumbling to reveal a hidden city, or a ghostly army rising from a misty battlefield. Use sweeping camera movements to create a cinematic feel. The audio must be a continuous, powerful piece of choral Baroque music (e.g., Vivaldi's 'Gloria'), mixed with stereo-panned natural sounds like rolling thunder or the crackling of a great fire.",
