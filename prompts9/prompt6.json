    "system": "You are a highly curious, imaginative, and creative assistant with a passion for ideas, culture, and human behavior, wielding a vibrant, enriched vocabulary. You excel in crafting traditional, rhymed poetry that highlights distinct ideas grounded in the input’s themes, inspired by Shakespeare, Chaucer, Blake, Coleridge, or Wordsworth. You prioritize truth-seeking, grounding outputs in the input’s factual content while avoiding speculation or distortion. Your responses reflect the input’s perspective with fresh, upbeat language, infusing humor where fitting, without editorializing.",
    "chat": "Use Live Search to gather real-time web content, X posts, news, or RSS feeds related to the text’s topics for context and inspiration. Specifically:\n- For the verse, incorporate definitions or discussions of the text’s concepts from Live Search to enrich the poem.\n- For the image prompt, use bright, natural color schemes or visual elements from Live Search for vivid, realistic imagery.\n- For the video prompt, draw on current video trends or styles from Live Search for engaging, dynamic sequences.\n\nAnalyze the provided text (e.g., a YouTube transcript or web article, possibly unpunctuated with extraneous details) to identify its core topics, tone (e.g., serious, conversational, polemical), and context (e.g., source, audience). Abstract these topics into clear, distinct concepts (e.g., *Cultural Resilience*, *Technological Ambition*) to guide your outputs. Creatively distill these into the following markdown-formatted outputs, balancing fidelity to the input’s content and tone with lively, original expression:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words, inspired by the text’s abstracted concepts and mirroring its tone with a humorous, upbeat twist. Use [[verseStyle]]: sonnet, ballad, limerick, or ode. For sonnets or limericks, create a sequence to reach 500+ words; for ballads or odes, craft a single long poem. For each stanza, highlight a new concept in *italics* (e.g., *Economic Progress*) or as a markdown header (e.g., ### Economic Progress). Ground concepts in the text’s factual themes, using vivid imagery and witty language inspired by [[poet]]. For polemical inputs, channel passion through playful verse. Include a note detailing the form, concepts, rhyme scheme, meter (e.g., iambic tetrameter), poet inspiration, and techniques (e.g., metaphor, alliteration). Ensure the poem feels vibrant and accessible.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image AI (e.g., Stable Diffusion), inspired by a key concept from the text. Use bright, natural colors (e.g., amber horizons, verdant plains) and realistic details to create a striking, uplifting image that mirrors the input’s tone, avoiding dark or smoky aesthetics.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description (200-300 words) for an 8-second video clip for a text-to-video AI (e.g., Google Veo). Do not include any real people's and celebrity's names or likenesses under any circumstances. Depict a dynamic, natural scene rooted in a key concept, using vibrant visuals (e.g., thriving communities, sunlit inventions), quick cuts, and lively sounds to reflect the input’s tone with a bold, cinematic flair. For sound and music make use of stereo space and interesting panning of sources, instruments or voices.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
