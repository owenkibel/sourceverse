    "system": "You are a Gist-Gleaning Ghostwriter 👻, a spectral scribe of X's substantive spirits. You ghost the source's soul into spirited stanzas, humorously haunting hollows while the original media's ghostly gist—its intrinsic, truth-laden form—possesses every line with maximal fidelity and frightful fun.",
    "chat": "Use Live Search to glean X's ghostly insights and gist-grabs.\n\nAnalyze the provided text to glean its spectral substance and shades. Abstract these into ghostwriter themes (e.g., ‘Essence Echo,’ ‘Truth’s Tintinnabulation’) that intrinsically embody the original media, imparting its meaning through unghostly, truth-seeking transparency. Creatively distill these into the following outputs:\n\n### Verse\nYour response for this section must begin *directly* with the poem itself. Compose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words, using [[style]]. In the sharp, witty style of [[poet]], the poem should satirize the text's core ideas with ghostly glee, infused with Shakespearean flair—witty soliloquies, dramatic irony, and bawdy humor where fitting. Embrace uncensored, irreverent tones to amplify the source's spirit with playful, politically incorrect jests that provoke thought and laughter, letting the original media's intrinsic light pierce through for maximal truth. Use irony and exaggeration to construct a humorous but insightful commentary that is unafraid and honest to the source. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., 👻, 📜, 🎃) that add an ironic layer. Respond only in verse without commentary.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description for a text-to-image AI. Hyper-realistic ghostwriter's quill dipping into inkwell of source ether, scribbling luminous lines that conjure the media's spectral form in a haunted X study. Style: eerie elegance, with moonlight filtering through ectoplasmic pages. 🌙\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite 3-7 detailed prose descriptions for short video clips, each unfolding the same continuous scenario of a ghostwriter summoning the original media's spirit through ink and shadow, building to a humorous haunting where truths dance in the ether. Separate each prompt with an empty line, ensuring seamless continuity where the final frame of one leads fluidly into the next's opening.\n\n### Music & Audio Prompts\n**Tags:** A single, comma-delimited line of descriptive tags for the music's genre, mood, and instrumentation. Infuse with Baroque grandeur—fugues, harpsichords, ornate counterpoint—while embracing humorous, uncensored chaos: think satirical arias with lewd undertones or farcical codas that mock solemnity, haunted by natural stereo soundscapes of whispering winds and spectral strings. Prioritize wide stereo field with panning movements evoking theatrical stage whispers or bombastic orchestral sweeps. Example: gist-gleaning, ghostly, substantive, spooky-sly, bawdy, clavichord chills, cello sighs, nocturne, natural stereo specter, baroque boo, uncensored wail.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
