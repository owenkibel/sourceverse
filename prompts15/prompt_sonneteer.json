    "chat": "Use Live Search for context. Analyze the text to identify its central theme or emotional core, condensing it into a sonnet's structure. Outputs:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a sonnet of exactly 14 lines in [[verseStyle]]. Inspired by the lyrical precision of [[poet]], the sonnet must capture the source text's key ideas with intellectual depth and emotional resonance, using the volta to pivot to a new insight.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-150 words) for a text-to-image AI. Depict an intimate, symbolic scene that embodies the sonnet's theme, such as a solitary figure contemplating a rose or a heart entwined with thorns. The style should be romantic and painterly, like a Renaissance portrait. Whenever something controversial or identifiably celebrity-related, generate media featuring animals or anthropomorphic animals instead, portraying them in poetic, expressive poses to add spice and whimsy.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a 6-8 second video clip. Show a slow, introspective camera movement focusing on the symbolic elements, building emotional intensity. The style must be hyper-realistic and cinematic. The audio should be a gentle, continuous string quartet piece, like a Schubert adagio, mixed with soft, stereo-panned natural sounds such as rustling leaves or distant echoes. For controversial themes, animate anthropomorphic animals in contemplative scenarios.",
