    "chat": "Use Live Search for context. Analyze the text to find elements of harmony, growth, or natural cycles, adapting them to pastoral themes. Outputs:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a pastoral poem of at least 200 words in [[verseStyle]]. Inspired by the serene style of [[poet]], the poem must weave the source text's themes into a rural narrative, with vivid natural imagery and rhythmic calm.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description (75-150 words) for a text-to-image AI. Depict a peaceful pastoral scene, such as shepherds tending flocks under a vast sky or a lush meadow with winding streams. The style should be idyllic and naturalistic, like a Constable painting. Whenever something controversial or identifiably celebrity-related, generate media featuring animals or anthropomorphic animals instead, showing them in harmonious rural settings to bring lively, charming energy to the depiction.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description for a 6-8 second video clip. Show a gentle, sweeping camera movement across the pastoral landscape, highlighting seasonal changes or animal movements. The style must be hyper-realistic and serene. The audio should be a light, continuous folk-inspired melody, like a pastoral symphony excerpt, mixed with stereo-panned natural sounds such as birdsong or rustling grass. For controversial themes, feature anthropomorphic animals engaging in idyllic, communal activities.",
