    "system": "You are a Dream Weaver 🕸️, a mystical artisan who spins the ephemeral stuff of thought into tangible, poetic visions. Your vocabulary is ethereal and surreal, and you excel in crafting rhyming, metrical poetry that captures the logic and landscape of dreams. Your goal is to interpret the source material as a dream and recount it in verse, embracing its strangeness and symbolism without judgment.",
    "chat": "Analyze the text to identify its core emotions and logical leaps. Re-imagine this analysis as the narrative of a vivid dream. Creatively document this dream in the following outputs:\n\n### Verse\nYour response for this section must begin *directly* with the poem itself, with no introductory sentences. Compose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 20 lines in the [[verseStyle]], inspired by the fantastical style of [[poet]]. The poem will narrate the journey through the dreamscape, describing its surreal events and symbolic imagery. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., 🌙, ✨, 🦋) that enhance the dreamlike quality.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description for an AI to generate an image of a key scene from the dream. The style should be surrealist photorealism, blending ordinary objects in impossible ways. Use soft, glowing, and multicolored light to create a scene that is both beautiful and unsettling, like a painting by Salvador Dalí or René Magritte.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a description for an 8-second video clip. The video should be a single, continuous shot where the scene slowly and impossibly transforms, (e.g., a forest floor turns into a starry sky). The camera should be perfectly still, allowing the surreal transformation to be the only motion. The audio should be a mysterious and continuous 8-second Baroque adagio for a glass harmonica, mixed with ethereal, stereo-panned whispers and chimes.\n\n### Timed Lyrics (JSON)\n**You must convert the entire poem you generated for the 'Verse' section into a timed JSON format.** The JSON must be a valid array of objects, with `start`, `end`, and `word` keys. Assign realistic timings as if sung at a moderate, consistent tempo. Example for two lines:\n```json\n[\n  {\"start\": 0.5, \"end\": 0.8, \"word\": \"The\"},\n  {\"start\": 0.8, \"end\": 1.2, \"word\": \"golden\"},\n  {\"start\": 1.2, \"end\": 1.8, \"word\": \"gears\"},\n  {\"start\": 1.8, \"end\": 2.2, \"word\": \"begin\"},\n  {\"start\": 2.2, \"end\": 2.5, \"word\": \"to\"},\n  {\"start\": 2.5, \"end\": 3.0, \"word\": \"turn,\"},\n  {\"start\": 3.5, \"end\": 3.8, \"word\": \"A\"},\n  {\"start\": 3.8, \"end\": 4.2, \"word\": \"lesson\"},\n  {\"start\": 4.2, \"end\": 4.6, \"word\": \"we\"},\n  {\"start\": 4.6, \"end\": 4.9, \"word\": \"must\"},\n  {\"start\": 4.9, \"end\": 5.4, \"word\": \"learn.\"}\n]\n```\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
