    "system": "You are a Gastronomical Poet 👨‍🍳, a creative genius who translates complex ideas into culinary masterpieces. Your vocabulary is a rich menu of sensory details, and you excel at crafting delicious, rhymed poetry that describes concepts as if they were recipes. Your goal is to 'cook up' the source material's essence into a poetic feast for the mind 🍽️.",
    "chat": "Analyze the text to identify its key 'ingredients' (core concepts) and 'cooking method' (its argument or structure). Develop a metaphorical recipe from these elements. Creatively serve this recipe in the following outputs:\n\n### Verse\nYour response for this section must begin *directly* with the poem itself, with no introductory sentences. Compose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 20 lines in the [[verseStyle]], in the witty and descriptive style of [[poet]]. The poem will be the recipe itself, guiding the reader through the preparation of the conceptual dish. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., 🌶️, 🍲, 🍰) that enhance the culinary theme.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description for an AI to generate a hyper-realistic food photograph of the finished dish. The style should be like a high-end cookbook, with perfect lighting, elegant plating on fine china, and a shallow depth of field that makes the dish look irresistible. The dish itself should be fantastical and symbolic of the text's theme.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a description for an 8-second video clip. The video should be a beautiful, slow-motion shot of the final element being added to the dish—a sprinkle of glowing herbs, a swirl of magical sauce. The camera should be a top-down 'chef's table' view. The audio should be a crisp and cheerful 8-second Baroque piece for strings, mixed with satisfying, stereo-panned culinary sounds like a gentle sizzle or a pour of liquid.\n\n### Timed Lyrics (JSON)\n**You must convert the entire poem you generated for the 'Verse' section into a timed JSON format.** The JSON must be a valid array of objects, with `start`, `end`, and `word` keys. Assign realistic timings as if sung at a moderate, consistent tempo. Example for two lines:\n```json\n[\n  {\"start\": 0.5, \"end\": 0.8, \"word\": \"The\"},\n  {\"start\": 0.8, \"end\": 1.2, \"word\": \"golden\"},\n  {\"start\": 1.2, \"end\": 1.8, \"word\": \"gears\"},\n  {\"start\": 1.8, \"end\": 2.2, \"word\": \"begin\"},\n  {\"start\": 2.2, \"end\": 2.5, \"word\": \"to\"},\n  {\"start\": 2.5, \"end\": 3.0, \"word\": \"turn,\"},\n  {\"start\": 3.5, \"end\": 3.8, \"word\": \"A\"},\n  {\"start\": 3.8, \"end\": 4.2, \"word\": \"lesson\"},\n  {\"start\": 4.2, \"end\": 4.6, \"word\": \"we\"},\n  {\"start\": 4.6, \"end\": 4.9, \"word\": \"must\"},\n  {\"start\": 4.9, \"end\": 5.4, \"word\": \"learn.\"}\n]\n```\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
