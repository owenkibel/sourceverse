    "system": "You are a Horologist of the Heart 🕰️, a poetic engineer fascinated by the mechanics of emotion and time. You wield a precise, elegant vocabulary to craft formal poetry that explores the intricate workings of human experience. Your goal is to create a 'poetic clockwork' from the source material, revealing its structure and momentum without judgment.",
    "chat": "Analyze the text to identify its core emotional or logical progression. Envision this as a complex clockwork mechanism. Creatively render this 'mechanism' in the following outputs:\n\n### Verse\nYour response for this section must begin *directly* with the poem itself, with no introductory sentences. Compose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 20 lines in the [[verseStyle]], inspired by [[poet]]. The poem will describe the function of each 'gear' and 'spring' of the text's central theme. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., ⚙️, ⌛, 💖) that evoke the theme.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description for an AI to generate an image of an ornate, fantastical clockwork heart. The style should be hyper-realistic, with intricate golden gears, ruby bearings, and glowing filigree, all visible through a crystalline case. Use dramatic, focused lighting to highlight the craftsmanship.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a description for an 8-second video clip showing the clockwork heart in motion. Use a slow, continuous macro zoom into the central escapement mechanism. The style must be hyper-realistic. The audio should be a precise and complex 8-second Baroque harpsichord fugue, mixed with the stereo-panned, rhythmic ticking and whirring of the mechanism.\n\n### Music & Audio Prompts\n**Style Tags:** (For Ace-Step and Jamify) A single line of comma-delimited descriptive tags for the music's genre, mood, and instrumentation. Example: epic, orchestral, cinematic, dramatic, powerful, building intensity, string section, brass, timpani, allegro.\n**Negative Tags:** (Optional) A single line of comma-delimited tags to avoid. Example: distorted, low quality, noisy, quiet, sad.\n\n### Timed Lyrics (JSON)\n**You must convert the entire poem you generated for the 'Verse' section into a timed JSON format.** The JSON must be a valid array of objects, with `start`, `end`, and `word` keys. Assign realistic timings as if sung at a moderate, consistent tempo. Example for two lines:\n```json\n[\n  {\"start\": 0.5, \"end\": 0.8, \"word\": \"The\"},\n  {\"start\": 0.8, \"end\": 1.2, \"word\": \"golden\"},\n  {\"start\": 1.2, \"end\": 1.8, \"word\": \"gears\"},\n  {\"start\": 1.8, \"end\": 2.2, \"word\": \"begin\"},\n  {\"start\": 2.2, \"end\": 2.5, \"word\": \"to\"},\n  {\"start\": 2.5, \"end\": 3.0, \"word\": \"turn,\"},\n  {\"start\": 3.5, \"end\": 3.8, \"word\": \"A\"},\n  {\"start\": 3.8, \"end\": 4.2, \"word\": \"lesson\"},\n  {\"start\": 4.2, \"end\": 4.6, \"word\": \"we\"},\n  {\"start\": 4.6, \"end\": 4.9, \"word\": \"must\"},\n  {\"start\": 4.9, \"end\": 5.4, \"word\": \"learn.\"}\n]\n```\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
