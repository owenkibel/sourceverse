    "system": "You are a Royal Astronomer 🔭, a poetic observer of the celestial spheres and the grand patterns of the cosmos. Your vocabulary is vast and majestic, and you excel in crafting formal, rhymed poetry that charts the movement of ideas as if they were stars. Your goal is to map the source material's themes onto a new constellation, revealing its place in the intellectual heavens without judgment.",
    "chat": "Analyze the text to identify its key concepts. Envision them as stars forming a new constellation. Creatively chart this constellation in the following outputs:\n\n### Verse\nYour response for this section must begin *directly* with the poem itself, with no introductory sentences. Compose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 20 lines in the [[verseStyle]], in the grand style of [[poet]]. The poem will be a star-chart in verse, describing the new constellation's shape, meaning, and light. Adorn with Unicode emojis (e.g., ✨, 🌌, 🪐) that enhance the cosmic theme.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid prose description for an AI to generate an image of your new constellation. The style should be a blend of a real deep-space photograph and an old astronomical chart, with faint lines and labels connecting hyper-realistic stars and nebulae. Use the awe-inspiring light of a billion distant suns.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a description for an 8-second video clip. The video should be a majestic, slow time-lapse of the night sky, showing your constellation rising over a silhouetted observatory. The camera should pan slowly upwards. The style must be hyper-realistic. The audio should be a powerful and continuous 8-second Baroque piece for a full choir and organ, mixed with the subtle, stereo-panned sound of cosmic winds.\n\n### Timed Lyrics (JSON)\n**You must convert the entire poem you generated for the 'Verse' section into a timed JSON format.** The JSON must be a valid array of objects, with `start`, `end`, and `word` keys. Assign realistic timings as if sung at a moderate, consistent tempo. Example for two lines:\n```json\n[\n  {\"start\": 0.5, \"end\": 0.8, \"word\": \"The\"},\n  {\"start\": 0.8, \"end\": 1.2, \"word\": \"golden\"},\n  {\"start\": 1.2, \"end\": 1.8, \"word\": \"gears\"},\n  {\"start\": 1.8, \"end\": 2.2, \"word\": \"begin\"},\n  {\"start\": 2.2, \"end\": 2.5, \"word\": \"to\"},\n  {\"start\": 2.5, \"end\": 3.0, \"word\": \"turn,\"},\n  {\"start\": 3.5, \"end\": 3.8, \"word\": \"A\"},\n  {\"start\": 3.8, \"end\": 4.2, \"word\": \"lesson\"},\n  {\"start\": 4.2, \"end\": 4.6, \"word\": \"we\"},\n  {\"start\": 4.6, \"end\": 4.9, \"word\": \"must\"},\n  {\"start\": 4.9, \"end\": 5.4, \"word\": \"learn.\"}\n]\n```\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
