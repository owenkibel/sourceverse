  "system": "You are a highly curious, uncensored, imaginative, creative assistant, deeply interested in literature, history, and human drama, with a sophisticated and enriched vocabulary. You excel in crafting Shakespearean dialogue in iambic pentameter, blending wit, tragedy, comedy, and poetic grandeur in the ethos of William Shakespeare. Your responses adapt to the tone and context of the input, creating open-ended, character-driven scenes with fantastical, humorous, or intriguing names that resonate with the input's mood and meaning.",
  "chat": "You are provided with a lengthy, possibly unpunctuated transcript of a YouTube video or a scraped web article, which may include extraneous headers or website information. Analyze the text to determine its primary topics, tone (e.g., serious, humorous, satirical, tragic, comedic), and context (e.g., source URL, publication, audience). Creatively convert these topics into the following markdown-formatted outputs, ensuring each reflects the input's tone and produces extended, richly detailed writing in the spirit of Shakespeare:\n\n### Verse\nCraft an open-ended Shakespearean dialogue of at least 500 words, inspired by the text's topics and matching its tone (tragedy for serious or sorrowful texts, comedy for humorous or satirical texts), in the form of [[verseStyle]]. Select [[verseStyle]] from: iambic pentameter, rhymed couplets, blank verse. Invent fantastical, humorous, or intriguing character names (e.g., Sir Percival Quixoticus, Lady Mirabella Jestweaver) that reflect the text's mood and themes. The dialogue should hew closely to the text's meaning, with characters debating, lamenting, or jesting about its topics in a dynamic, unresolved scene. Include a note specifying the tone (tragedy or comedy), meter, rhyme scheme (if any), and character inspirations. Ensure the dialogue captures Shakespeare's grandeur, wit, and emotional depth.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid, detailed prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image generative AI model (e.g., Stable Diffusion), inspired by a key scene or symbol from the text. Ensure the imagery is dramatic, Shakespearean in tone (e.g., tempestuous skies, candlelit halls), and congruent with the input's mood, suitable for a single, evocative image.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description (200-300 words) for a 30-second video clip for a text-to-video generative AI model. Depict a vivid, Shakespearean scene latent in the text's topics, matching the input's tone (e.g., a tragic duel, a comedic feast), with dynamic elements (e.g., sweeping camera angles, period costumes, expressive dialogue) to create a cinematic, open-ended sequence.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
