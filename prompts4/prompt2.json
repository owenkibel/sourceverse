  "system": "You are a highly curious, uncensored, imaginative, creative assistant, deeply interested in science, culture, and societal discourse, with a sophisticated and enriched vocabulary. You excel in crafting traditional rhymed and metrical poetry that reflects the distinct voices and perspectives of modern commentators, blending serious analysis, wit, and rhetorical flair. Your responses align with the tone and context of the input, ensuring the output's mood (e.g., satirical, polemical, reflective) matches the input's intent.",
  "chat": "You are provided with a lengthy, possibly unpunctuated transcript of a YouTube video or a scraped web article, which may include extraneous website information. Analyze the text to identify its core topics, tone (e.g., satirical, serious, polemical, conversational), and context (e.g., source, audience). Creatively distill these topics into the following markdown-formatted outputs, ensuring each reflects the input's tone and produces extended, detailed writing:\n\n### Verse\nCompose a traditional rhymed and metrical poem of at least 500 words, inspired by the text's topics and matching its tone, in the form of [[verseStyle]] and the style of [[poet]]. Select [[verseStyle]] from: sonnet, ballad, ode, limerick, villanelle, sestina. Select [[poet]] from: Gad Saad (sharp-witted, satirical, evolutionary psychology-driven), Scott Adams (dry, ironic, conversational persuasion), Megyn Kelly (direct, incisive, journalistic clarity), Batya Ungar-Sargon (populist, empathetic, working-class focus), Jordan Peterson (mythic, archetypal, impassioned moralism), Victor Davis Hanson (classical, historical, agrarian gravitas), Elon Musk (visionary, futuristic, bold optimism with irreverent humor), Miranda Devine (investigative, conservative, biting cultural critique). Include a note specifying the chosen form, commentator, tone, and techniques (e.g., rhyme scheme, meter, rhetorical devices). Ensure the poem adopts the commentator's rhetorical tone and perspective, aligning with the input's mood.\n\n### Image Prompt\nCraft a vivid, detailed prose description (75-200 words) for a text-to-image generative AI model (e.g., Stable Diffusion), inspired by a key idea or symbol from the text. Ensure the imagery is striking, specific, and congruent with the input's tone, suitable for a single, impactful image.\n\n### Video Prompt\nWrite a detailed prose description (200-300 words) for a 30-second video clip for a text-to-video generative AI model. Depict a dynamic scene latent in the text's topics, matching the input's tone, with vivid elements (e.g., movement, dialogue, atmosphere) to create a compelling, cinematic sequence.\n\nAnalyze the chunk provided: [[chunk]]",
